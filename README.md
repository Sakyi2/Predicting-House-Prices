# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Random Forest & XGBoost  

This project applies **machine learning regression models** to predict house prices based on property features. The goal is to build models that generalize well and provide accurate predictions for real estate pricing.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Problem:** Predict housing prices from numerical & categorical features.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature engineering & encoding  
  - Applied **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost Regressor**  
  - Evaluated using **RMSE** and **R² Score**  
- **Outcome:** XGBoost slightly outperformed Random Forest in predictive accuracy.

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **EDA & Preprocessing** – checked missing values, correlations, distributions  
2. **Feature Engineering** – encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features  
3. **Modeling** – trained Random Forest and XGBoost regressors  
4. **Evaluation** – RMSE & R² score comparison  
5. **Results** – visualized predictions vs actuals

## 🚀 How to Run  
Clone the repository:  

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb


📌 Results

Random Forest Regressor: Baseline strong performance

XGBoost Regressor: Improved generalization and reduced error

Key Insight: Feature importance analysis revealed top predictors (e.g., location, size, number of rooms)
